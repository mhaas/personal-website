My master's thesis is concerned with compositional sentiment recognition. I propose
a weakly supervised technique to create sentiment lexicons from product reviews.
Furthermore, I show how semi-supervised methods and ensemble learning can improve
sentiment analysis performance in a resource-scarce setting. A crowdsourced German
sentiment treebank is used to for training and evaluation. On this compositional
dataset, I further investigate the relevance of compositionality for sentiment analysis.
