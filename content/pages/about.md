When I am not at University studying or working, chances are you will find me doing
one of three things:

* Programming for fun
* Cooking & Eating
* Working out at [CrossFit Rhein-Neckar](http://www.crossfit-rhein-neckar.de/)


Programming for fun
-------------------
I enjoy solving day-to-day problems: whether it is a small shell script to
make my life a bit easier or a nice HTML5 app for my smartphone,
there is always an itch to scratch.

Cooking
-------
I like cooking, and I enjoy experimenting in the kitchen.
I tend to be unhappy with the quality of ready-made meals and most Mensa food, so
I have become quite proficient at throwing together a tasty dinner in
10 minutes.
New kitchen appliances make me happy, so does shopping for blends of spices.

Training
----------------------
Sports are an important part of my life, as they complement my mostly
sedentary life as a developer and student.
My main sport is CrossFit and I train with the great folks at
[CrossFit Rhein-Neckar](http://www.crossfit-rhein-neckar.de/).
