I am extremely happy to announce that a paper written by Yannick Versley and me
was accepted at
[NAACL HLT 2015](http://naacl.org/naacl-hlt-2015/):

> Michael Haas and Yannick Versley (2015) Subsentential Sentiment on a Shoestring:
> A Crosslingual Analysis of Compositional Classification. In Proceedings of NAACL-HLT 2015. 

The submission is partially based on
[my master's thesis]({filename}/pages/ma-thesis.md).
We will also release the **Hei**delberg **S**entiment **T**reebank after the conference.
**HeiST** is our German dataset for compositional sentiment analysis.
